# Rendering Pipeline

This repository includes the rendering pipeline for [**SynthSL: Expressive Humans for Sign Language Image Synthesis**](https://www.dfki.de/fileadmin/user_upload/import/14793_FG2024_SynthSL.pdf) (FG 2024), to render synthetic data based on the SMPL-x model.

# SynthSL

SynthSL is publicly available for research purposes. 
To get access to the dataset, please send an email to jilliam_maria.diaz_barros [at] dfki [dot] de.

# Sign Image Synthesis Pipeline

The implementation of our SwinGenerator and sign image synthesis architecture can be forked from [here](https://github.com/jilliam/SynthSLGen). 


# Setup and demo
